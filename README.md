## How to visualise dots grouped as cloud in grid format

![Process visualozation](https://github.com/DukachY/Cloud_to_grid/blob/master/process_visual.png)

To resolve the problem of cloud to grid transformation I used this [example](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/CloudToGrid/blob/master/CloudToGrid.ipynb)  
But *lap* and *hungarian* algorithm didn't work for me. That's why I used **linear_sum_assignment** from **scipy.optimize**  
  
Look more in ['Cloud to grid.ipynb'](https://github.com/DukachY/Cloud_to_grid/blob/master/Cloud%20to%20grid.ipynb).
